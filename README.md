# TinkerCAD Arduino

Hola Freshies!         

Welcome to IITM and Electronics club, and we hope you all had a great session and liked it.

Here are few key resources that we have jot down to help you with the TinkerCAD if at all you missed something during the session.

### Logging in to TinkerCAD
1. Go to [TinkerCAD's website](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
2. Login to the website with your google account.
3. Move to the Circuits part, which you could see in the left dashboard.
4. Here you could access your exixsting circuits if any, or could create a new one.

### Gas Concentration detection and alert system 

This is the one that was live demonstrated during the session. Here you make your own gas detection cum alert system using the MQ-2 gas sensor and arduino microcontroller. Check the complete desription and the code [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/Orientation%20Session-Gas%20Leakage%20Detection.md).

### Simple DIY simulations in TinkerCAD

Here are some simple tinkercad simulations that you could try out on your own. These are very basic stuff that you can do it yourself to get familiarised with tinkercad and arduino. First check out the problem statement and try it yourself, working? Congrats, not working? Fret not, debug yourself and try again, still didn't work then check out the solutions provided. If in case you aren't understanding some part, feel free to ask your doubts in the whatsapp group. 

1. Blinking In-built LED in Arduino
2. Blinking an external LED in Arduino
3. Controlling LED with push buttons
4. Getting readings from a Potentiometer.
5. Control an LED's brightness using a photo resistor.

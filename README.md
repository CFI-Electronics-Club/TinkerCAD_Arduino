# TinkerCAD Arduino

Hola Freshies!         

Welcome to IITM and Electronics club, and we hope you all had a great session and liked it.

Here are few key resources that we have jot down to help you with the TinkerCAD if at all you missed something during the session. Are you wondering how the circuit that was displayed as GIF in the poster for the session worked, here is the code for that check it out [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/%22Hello%20Freshies%22%20Circuit.md)

### Logging in to TinkerCAD
1. Go to [TinkerCAD's website](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
2. Login to the website with your google account.
3. Move to the Circuits part, which you could see in the left dashboard.
4. Here you could access your exixsting circuits if any, or could create a new one.

### Gas Concentration detection and alert system 

This is the one that was live demonstrated during the session. Here you make your own gas detection cum alert system using the MQ-2 gas sensor and arduino microcontroller. Check the complete desription and the code [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/Orientation%20Session-Gas%20Leakage%20Detection.md).

## Simple DIY simulations in TinkerCAD

Here are some simple tinkercad simulations that you could try out on your own. These are very basic stuff that you can do it yourself to get familiarised with tinkercad and arduino. First check out the problem statement and try it yourself, working? Congrats, not working? Fret not, debug yourself and try again, still didn't work then check out the solutions provided. If in case you aren't understanding some part, feel free to ask your doubts in the whatsapp group. 

### 1. Blinking In-built LED and an external LED in Arduino
This is the basic and the simplest simulation that you could do on arduino. You basically control an internal LED present in arduino (attached to PIN13) and also the external LED that is connected to the breadboard. Check the complete problem statement [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/Problem%20Statements%201%20%26%202.md). 

### 2. Controlling LED with push buttons
Controlling the LED using the delay would have been simpler for you, now try controlling the LED with a push button. Complete details [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/Problem%20Statement%203.md)

### 3. Getting readings from a Potentiometer
Once you ace the LED simulations, try this out where get the readings from a Potentiometer. Full details [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/Problem%20Statement%204.md)

### 4. Control an LED's brightness using a photo resistor
The above ones could have been an easier one, then continue trying this thing were you kind a get started with sensors, photo resistors are the simplest form of variable resistance that works based on the brightness of the light. Complete Problem statement [here]()

### 5. Control a servo using Potentiometer

# Problem statements 1 and 2 #

Introduction: 

I hope most of you would have attended the live session. If not, fret not. Just go through the "[Main Readme.MD](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/README.md)". That would give you some information about TinkerCAD and the instructions. Once you have practiced working with the environment, you can solve the Problem statements on your own.

## Problem statement 1: Blinking an in-built LED (Pin 13):

In the Arduino board, there is an in-built LED which is present to indicate whether the power supply is proper and the board is properly functioning. Since, we are just now starting on, the PS is simple. Just blink that LED periodically, i.e., switch it on for 50 percent of the period and switch it off in the next half.

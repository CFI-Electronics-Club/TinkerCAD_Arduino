# Problem statements 1 and 2 #

Introduction: 
I hope most of you would have attended the live session. If not, fret not. Just go through the "[Main Readme.MD](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/TinkerCAD_Arduino/blob/main/README.md)". That would give you some information about TinkerCAD and the instructions. Once you have practiced working with the environment, you can solve the Problem statements on your own.
